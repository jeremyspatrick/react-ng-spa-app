# Angular and React Micro Frontend


Angular and React Micro Frontend managed from a single root project

---

## Setup localhost


cd react-ng-spa-app

npm i

npm start

All microfrontends can be viewed from the root project at http://localhost:9000

## Deployment

From the react-ng-spa-app folder run "npm run build" 

This will create a deployable dist folder in each of the micro apps which are individually deployable. For the initial deployment all contents in each of the dist folders should be deployed.
